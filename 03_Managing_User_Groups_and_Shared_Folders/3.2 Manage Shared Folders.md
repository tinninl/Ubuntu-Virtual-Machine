# 1. Create two new shared folders

Only groupA (john) can access sharedA and only groupB (jane) can access sharedB

    `sudo mkdir /home/sharedA`
    `sudo mkdir /home/sharedB`

# 2. Set the owner/group permissions for the folders

By default, root owns both folders.

    `sudo chown :groupA /home/sharedA` - change group owner
    `sudo chmod 770 /home/sharedA` - set group permissions
    `sudo chmod g+s /home/sharedA` - set file inheritance

    `sudo nano /home/sharedA/fileA.txt` - create a txt file

See set_shared_folders_permissions.jpg to view what it should look like

# 3. Login to john and read fileA.txt

    john will have access to the sharedA folder but NOT the sharedB folder

# 4. Repeat for jane in groupB with sharedB and fileB.txt
