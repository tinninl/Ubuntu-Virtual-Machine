# 1. Close the VM and open settings in Virtualbox

# 2. Under 'Network', select 'NAT' under 'Attached to' and add a port forwarding rule.

Rule name: ssh. Host port: 2222. Guest port: 22.

Notes: Why ports 2222 and 22? Any host port above 1024 is typically 'free' and can be used. 22 is usually the port for ssh.
