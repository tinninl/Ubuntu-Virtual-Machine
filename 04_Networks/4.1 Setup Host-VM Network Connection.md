# 1. Setup an adapter

Under settings, under networks, configure adapter 2 to 'Host-Only Adapter'

# 2. Configure a static ip for the VM

 `ip addr` or `ip a` to view ip addresses. We notice that there is no ip addr for enp0s8 yet.

Find the file that contains our network plan

 `sudo ls /etc/netplan` the folder network plan should have a file listed

mine is 50-cloud-init.yaml

Edit the file to add a static ip address. I chose 192.168.56.2
since my host device had an ip address of 192.168.56.1.

See netplan.jpg

Try viewing the ip addr again. See ip addr.jpg

# 3. Allow pings to go thru Windows firewall

Add an inbound rule to allow ICMPv4 echo requests. Basically allow the VM to ping your host machine

# 4. Ping test

Test pings both ways!
